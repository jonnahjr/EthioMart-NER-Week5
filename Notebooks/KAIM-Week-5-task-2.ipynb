        "Labeling a subset of the dataset in CoNLL format for Named Entity Recognition (NER) involves tagging each word in the text with its corresponding entity label. The goal is to annotate tokens as entities such as **Product**, **Price**, and **Location** in Amharic text. Here's how you can approach the task:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Understand the CoNLL Format**\n",
        "   - In the **CoNLL format**, each word (token) from the text is placed on a separate line followed by its **entity label**.\n",
        "   - Blank lines separate different sentences or messages.\n",
        "   - Common entity labels include:\n",
        "     - **B-Product** (Beginning of a product)\n",
        "     - **I-Product** (Inside a product)\n",
        "     - **B-LOC** (Beginning of a location)\n",
        "     - **I-LOC** (Inside a location)\n",
        "     - **B-PRICE** (Beginning of a price)\n",
        "     - **I-PRICE** (Inside a price)\n",
        "     - **O** (Outside of any entity)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Set Up the Data**\n",
        "   - You will work on the **Message** column from the dataset. This column contains text describing various products, prices, and locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Tokenize the Text**\n",
        "   - **Tokenization** is the process of splitting the text into individual words or tokens.\n",
        "   - You can use libraries like **spaCy**, **NLTK**, or manual splitting methods to break the Amharic text into individual words.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Annotate the Entities**\n",
        "   - Manually go through the tokens and annotate them using the following rules:\n",
        "     - The **first word** of a product name, location, or price gets a **B-** prefix (e.g., **B-Product**, **B-LOC**, **B-PRICE**).\n",
        "     - Any subsequent word within the same entity is tagged with the **I-** prefix (e.g., **I-Product**, **I-LOC**, **I-PRICE**).\n",
        "     - Words that are not part of any entity are labeled **O**.\n",
        "   \n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "If you have the following message:  \n",
        "\"አዲሱ የህጻን ቦትል በ 200 ብር ተሽጠዋል\"\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Tokenized text:**\n",
        "   - አዲሱ, የህጻን, ቦትል, በ, 200, ብር, ተሽጠዋል\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Labeled in CoNLL format:**\n",
        "   ```plaintext\n",
        "   አዲሱ O\n",
        "   የህጻን B-Product\n",
        "   ቦትል I-Product\n",
        "   በ B-PRICE\n",
        "   200 I-PRICE\n",
        "   ብር I-PRICE\n",
        "   ተሽጠዋል O\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Repeat for 30-50 Messages**\n",
        "   - Label **30-50 messages** in this format, ensuring that each entity in the text is annotated according to the rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Save the Output**\n",
        "   - Once all the annotations are complete, save the labeled dataset in a **plain text file** (e.g., **labeled_data.txt**).\n",
        "   - Ensure the format follows the CoNLL standard: **one token per line**, with its label separated by a space, and blank lines between each message.\n"
